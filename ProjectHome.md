## Overview ##
We will build **Multiple Camera Support** module for [CCV](http://ccv.nuigroup.com/).

By integrating the methods related to Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction of OpenCV into CCV, we can make the CCV track the blobs with the relationship between the multi-cams and the screen, and then we can track the objects and fiducials by stitching the undistorted and rectified captured by multi-cams.
